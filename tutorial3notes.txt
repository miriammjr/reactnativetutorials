Moved index.tsx and explore.tsx to app from app/(tabs)
Renamed tabs/_layout.tsx so stop it from showing up

Now there's an annoying "index" header on the top bar. IT was in the tabs layout folder.

This needs expo router:
so do this:
npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar
***
import { Link } from "expo-router";
***
Link is similar to the <a> in HTML.
***
<Link href="/explore">Explore</Link>
***
It's red squiggling but works so whatever.
It doesn't work if you do "/explore.tsx" for some reason but that's chill

Style: 
textDecorationLine: 'underline',

To turn the link into a button:
1. add "asChild" to the end of the opening tag
    - that will allow the button inside to do the onClick stuff
2. import Pressable from "react-native";
3. Inside the Link, surround the text with <Text> tags.
4. Surround the <Text> tags with <Pressable> tags.

Now it's ugly but it works.

TO ADD ONE LINE OF STYLING TO SOMETHING:
style = {{marginHorizontal: 'auto'}}

Right now, we're using the Root Layout, not the one in (tabs).
This uses Stack. 
Right now, it goes to (tabs) and not-found.
***
      <Stack>
        <Stack.Screen
          name="(tabs)"
          options={{ headerShown: false }}
        />
        <Stack.Screen name="+not-found" />
      </Stack>
***
going to add a stack screen for each file we have rn

        <Stack.Screen
          name="index"
          options={{ title: "Home" }}
        />

The title is what will show up on the header now.
The option "headerShown: false" will stop the header from showing up at all.

+not-found: what will show up if we request a screen that doesn't exist.

***
export default function NotFoundScreen() {
  return (
    <>
      <Stack.Screen options={{ title: 'Oops!' }} />
      <ThemedView style={styles.container}>
        <ThemedText type="title">This screen does not exist.</ThemedText>
        <Link href="/" style={styles.link}>
          <ThemedText type="link">Go to home screen!</ThemedText>
        </Link>
      </ThemedView>
    </>
  );
}
***
The Stack is inside of the component, so that means that it will override the options in the layout file.

A file with parentheses like (tab) is a group.
