WRITE UP

(I just noticed the “One extra credit opportunity available per student unless exception provided by instructor” thing on top of the assignment page, but I did this one too and I’m not sure my coding event attendance was good enough to count for credit)

I did the React Native Full Course for Beginners. I chose to do this because I felt like I needed help learning it. A lot of it was helpful, but a lot of it was covered in class as well, so it was a mix of things.

I learned a lot about how React components are built. Before, I was mostly confused on what was going on, only vaguely recognising things as looking like HTML, but now I know how things are built and how things work. Since I already knew a lot of CSS, I didn’t really bother typing it all out, so the second app is ugly, but I added the things I didn’t know how to do previously. Additionally, some things I was able to use in the group project, such as the icons and header bar information.

One thing I was hoping for was more information about hooks. Unfortunately, it seems that this tutorial assumed prior knowledge of hooks, so that wasn’t covered and I am still just as lost on hooks as I was before. While the todo list app was very similar to what we did in class, and I’m sure I could have used the in-class code as a reference and made it myself, I wouldn’t be able to know what to do on my own.

I think I need to figure out what hooks are, so I’ll need to do some sort of tutorial that will cover that in a lot of depth.
