To stop the header from showing on everything in the stack, put 
screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}
inside the opening tag for the stack. 

        <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}>
          <Stack.Screen name="index" />
          <Stack.Screen name="todos/[id]" />
        </Stack>


To call each individual item: 
const { id } = useLocalSearchParams() 

Can use onLongPress instead of usePress to make it require a longer one. 
IT doesn't work???
I don't know why 
:(
It works if I switch to this:
      <Pressable
        onPress={() => toggleTodo(item.id)}
        onLongPress={() => handlePress(item.id)}
      >
So I don't know why but ok


I'm kind of lost now to be honest.
