Extensions: Expo Tools, React Native Tools, ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native,  vscode-icons


For when I inevitably forget how to push a folder to github: https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github


Creating app:
npx create-expo-app@latest
To get old versions of stuff, change the package.json file, then do npm install

Expo apps getting started -> set up your environment will show how to get ios and android emulators and stuff


Start an app:
npx expo start

w - opens app in the browser

ctrl-shift-i: dev tools -> little phone/computer icon lets you see it in mobile mode on the browser (a little better options on chrome than firefox -- lets you choose device)

to create a blank project:
npx create-expo-app@latest --template blank 


With that extension, typing rnfe will create a "react native functional export component":
selecting something + ctrld will let you edit all things with that name at once

***

import { View, Text } from "react-native";
import React from "react";

const index = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>index</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default index;

***

press r to reload app

At first, the component will not have any styling. So CSS needs to be added.
Import StyleSheet from react-native
Then, create a stylesheet with:
*** const styles = Stylesheet.create({}) ***
{} - an object

***
container: {
    flex: 1, // makes the container fill the screen
    flexDirection: "column", // different from CSS - uses camel case instead 
}
***

This isn't applied yet, so put it inside the opening tag of the elements:
***
<View style={styles.container}>
<Text style={styles.text}>
***

Put images into the assets folder.
import ImageBackground to use images.
Wrap everything in the view inside of it (but not the view itself)
You have to import the images like the other stuff, but 
*** import icedCoffeeImg from "../assets/images/iced-coffee.png"; ***
doesn't work on typescript.
which is annoying
but this worked:
    https://graffino.com/til/how-to-import-images-in-typescript
Then you can set the image background:
***
<ImageBackground source={imagename.png}></ImageBackground>
***
Resize property: ***resizeMode = "cover"*** will make sure it covers the whole screen

app.json file: a big big object
There are a lot of properties, including splash. That's the little loading page thing. I think. 
So just change that to another image.
I'm not actually sure what the splash screen is ngl
maybe i broke it
running npx expo prebuild to see what happens. did not work
deleted splash png. also did not work
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
running npx expo start --dev-client --clear
did not work
trying this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65749724/expo-splashscreen-not-changing
did not work

idk whatever it's not too important ig
shake phone to be able to see dev tools and the icon
